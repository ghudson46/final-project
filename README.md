# KickBack

## Description
KickBack is the perfect platform to hangout with your friends, without needing to be in the same room! Watch a movie, share a youtube video, or simply just chat in a private room.
Just because you have to be 6 feet apart, doesn't mean you have to be apart.

Once the user is logged in, they can navigate through Home, Profile, Join Room, and Create Room. The profile page will display the user's name, email, and google picture if the user signed up with Google. If the user used a default email, a placeholder image will be displayed along with their email. The profile page will also display past rooms the user has created or joined.

Both the join room and create room pages show similar displays. The user may enter in a previously created room name on the join page to enter a room, or create a new room on the create room page by typing in a unique room name.

On the room page, we are able to search for a video utilizing the YouTube API. The page will be auto-populated with the first video that would come up from a regular youtube search. The chat box is displayed next, which display all message entered by all users. You may Delete message history, and all users currently in the room are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
